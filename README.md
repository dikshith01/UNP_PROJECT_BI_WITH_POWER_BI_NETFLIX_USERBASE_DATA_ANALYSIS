# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_NETFLIX_USERBASE_DATA_ANALYSIS

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for comprehensive Netflix userbase and subscription analysis, transforming raw customer data into meaningful visual insights for data-driven decision-making. The dashboard covers total users, revenue distribution, subscription types, device preferences, gender-based revenue patterns, and country-wise performance, helping identify revenue drivers and user segmentation trends across markets. It highlights the Basic plan as the most popular subscription, evaluates revenue contributions by gender and device type, and compares country-wise user distribution to support targeted marketing strategies. The report also assesses user demographics by age group, subscription plan performance, and revenue patterns to enable proactive planning and better resource allocation for customer acquisition and retention. Built with dynamic filters, KPI indicators, and drill-down capabilities by country, gender, and subscription type, the dashboard enhances analytical depth and usability while supporting strategic subscription growth initiatives. Key findings indicate that the 30-49 age group forms the largest user segment, laptops are the most-used streaming device, and the United States generates the highest revenue. Actionable recommendations include promoting Premium plans through exclusive features, targeting younger audiences with tailored campaigns, and expanding marketing efforts in lower-subscription countries. This project was completed in collaboration with UNP, whose structured guidance supported the data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, visualization design, and overall dashboard development process.
